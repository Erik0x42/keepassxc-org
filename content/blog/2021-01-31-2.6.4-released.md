Today we are releasing the fourth 2.6 maintenance update, **KeePassXC 2.6.4**.

This new version fixes various minor bugs, updates a vulnerable third-party dependency, and enables live theme switching.
Whereas previously, the user had to restart KeePassXC in order to switch between light and dark mode, this can now be done
at runtime without the need for a restart. On Windows and macOS, the application now also responds automatically
to theme changes in the system, working much better with Big Sur's "Auto" theme.

<!--more-->

The pre-built Windows and macOS binaries ship with an updated version of libgcrypt,
(the third-party library we use for cryptographic primitives), which fixes a
[buffer overflow vulnerability](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2021q1/000456.html).
Since KeePassXC does not decrypt arbitrary untrusted data (TLS for fetching Favicons is not handled by libgcrypt),
we believe the impact on our users to be low, but recommend upgrading ASAP nonetheless. AppImages for Linux ship
with an older version of the library which was not affected.

As an additional treat, KeePassXC 2.6.4 is the first release for which we provide native ARM64 builds for the new
Apple Silicon M1 Macs. For the time being, the ARM64 build comes without support for signed KeeShare containers due
to dependency incompatibilities. If this functionality is needed, use the Intel build instead (which works just
as fine with Rosetta2).

The new release can be downloaded from our
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download), our
[Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~phoerious/+archive/ubuntu/keepassxc/),
and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/keepassxc/).

Please report any bugs you encounter at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues).
We are also available on Matrix and IRC in case you have any other issues with the new release
(see [Contact](/team/#contact)).
