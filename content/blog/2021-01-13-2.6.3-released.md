Today we are releasing the third 2.6 maintenance update, **KeePassXC 2.6.3**.

This update includes support for new KeePass2 features that increase the security of your database: 
XML Key File Version 2 and Argon2id. The new XML Key File makes it easier to print your key file for 
storage and recovery. This is now the default key file created by KeePass2. KeePassXC continues to
generate hashed key files by default for the time being, though an XML key file can be generated by
choosing the`*.keyx` file extension. The benefits of Argon2id 
are discussed [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/49969).

Along with these improvements, this update includes better support for CSV import/export, protection from
Windows 10 clipboard history, macOS Big Sur icon styling, and improvements to the user interface and user
experience.
