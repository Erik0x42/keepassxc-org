Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.3**, the third maintenance update for the 2.7 stable series.

This release introduces saved searches, enhanced tags support, improvements to the entry preview panel,
a `db-edit` command to the CLI, and corrects numerous bugs and crashes. We have also made several quality
of life improvements to the program such as tabbing around the interface and preventing focus locks. This
update also provides better handling of dark/light mode detection on macOS and Linux.
