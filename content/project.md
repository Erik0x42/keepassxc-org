**KeePassXC** is a modern, secure, and open-source password manager that stores and manages your most sensitive information.

You can run KeePassXC on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. KeePassXC is for people with extremely high demands of secure
personal data management. It saves many different types of information, such as usernames, passwords, URLs, attachments,
and notes in an offline, encrypted file that can be stored in any location, including private and public cloud solutions.

For easy identification and management, user-defined titles and icons can be specified for entries. In addition, entries
are sorted in customizable groups. An integrated search function allows you to use advanced patterns to easily find any entry
in your database. A customizable, fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility allows you to create passwords with any
combination of characters or easy to remember passphrases.

### Quick Start
The [QuickStart Guide]({{< baseurl >}}docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted.html) gets you started using KeePassXC on your
Windows, macOS, or Linux computer using pre-compiled binaries from the [downloads page]({{< baseurl >}}download).
Additionally, individual Linux distributions may ship their own versions, so please check your distribution's package
