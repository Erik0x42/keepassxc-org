    <h3>Donate</h3>
    <p>KeePassXC is free, but we have a few expenses such as the server our website is running on or renewal fees for
        software certificates for Windows and macOS.
    <p>It is much appreciated if you want to support us financially by donating a few bucks to cover our costs
        or perhaps simply buy us a beer which we can drink to you once in a while.

    <p>There are various ways you can donate money to us, which are:

    <ul>
