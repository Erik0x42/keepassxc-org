After two beta releases, today we are proud to release **KeePassXC 2.4.0**!

With this release, we have streamlined our code, improved the user interface,
and added several new and exciting features. We have merged a total of 116 pull
requests that implemented 12 new features, resolved 28 bugs, and closed 73 issues.

Among the highlights of this release are a new database creation wizard, advanced
search, KeeShare database sharing and synchronization, update checks, OpenSSH for
Windows support, and a QR Code generator for TOTP.

Thanks to our active community, KeePassXC is now available in 40 languages!
