We are very excited to announce the release of **KeePassXC 2.2.0**!
We have worked long and hard to bring you lots of new features and bug fixes in a well-rounded release.
Among the top highlights of this release are

* YubiKey challenge-response support for strengthening your database encryption key
* a generator for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
* a diceware password generator
* a command line interface (CLI)
* CSV database import
* true portable mode with the config file residing in the same directory as the application
* automatic database locking when you lock your desktop session

We also feature a new welcome screen providing quick access to common actions when no database is loaded:

Besides these highlights, KeePassXC ships with many other new features and improvement. With
[167 closed issue reports](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/milestone/2?closed=1), 2.2.0 is
by far the biggest KeePassXC release so far and we thank all contributors who have made this amazing release possible.
