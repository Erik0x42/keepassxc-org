Today we released another maintenance release. We expect this to be the last release in the 2.1.x series before 2.2.0.
The release mostly fixes smaller bugs and brings minor user interface improvements.

We also fixed a possible overflow in the external zxcvbn library, which we use for assessing password quality.
We strongly recommend upgrading KeePassXC as soon as possible, but don't believe this issue to be exploitable.
