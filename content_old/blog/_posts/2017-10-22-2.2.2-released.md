Today we announce with **KeePassXC 2.2.2** the second patch release for KeePassXC 2.2.x.
This release contains mostly fixes for our AppImage and Snap packages, but als numerous
other bug fixes.

Most notably, users can now use the KeePassXC CLI tool from the AppImage binary by
running it with the `cli` argument and AppImages now also correctly detect a plugged-in
YubiKey. We also fixed an annoying issue where KeePassXC would always report entries
without URLs to KeePassHTTP browser extensions.

In addition, we redesigned and greatly extended our [list of FAQs](/docs) for you.
