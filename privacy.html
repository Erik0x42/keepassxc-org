    <h3 id="privacy-website">Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>When you visit our website, we collect the following data:

    <ul>
        <li>Your anonymized IP address (we store only the first 2 byte for IPv4 and the first 6 byte for IPv6)
        <li>Your browser user agent and plugin configuration
        <li>Your HTTP referrer if coming from another website
        <li>Your screen size configuration
        <li>Your geo location as far as we can determine it from the anonymized IP address
    </ul>

    <p>The browser user agent usually contains the following information:

    <ul>
        <li>Your browser name and version
        <li>Your operating system name and version
        <li>Your processor architecture
    </ul>

    <p>All collected data is used for statistical purposes only, does not allow personal identification and is not shared with any
        third parties. Statistics are generated using a self-hosted <a href="https://piwik.org/" target="_blank">Piwik</a>
        installation.
    
    <p>Visitor logs are deleted after 90 days and detailed reports after 12 months. Only basic trend metrics are kept after this time.

    <p>You can opt out of browser data collection at any time by clicking this
    <a href="https://analytics.keepassxc.org/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&amp;action=optOut&amp;language=en" target="_blank">opt-out
        link</a> and following the instructions. Alternatively, you can also configure your browser to send a
        <a href="http://donottrack.us/" target="_blank">Do Not Track</a> header.
    
    <p>The website and all data related to it is hosted at <a href="https://uberspace.de/" target="_blank">uberspace.de</a>,
        which is also where your email will be stored when you send us one. Uberspace.de are only responsible for providing
        the needed IT infrastructure and do not access or use your data directly.
    
    <h4 id="privacy-keepassxc">KeePassXC and KeePassXC-Browser</h4>
    <p>KeePassXC and KeePassXC-Browser are run locally on your computer. At no time will any of your stored personal data be
        sent to us or a third party. That's how it works. Period.
    <p>KeePassXC in particular will only ever contact a server on the Internet as per explicit request from the user (e.g.,
        in order to download a website favicon for an entry).
    <p>KeePassXC-Browser has an automatic update check, which will contact GitHub only so as to check for the most recent
        KeePassXC version. This check is optional and can be turned off in the settings. No additional data will be
        transmitted besides what is necessary to establish a connection. For further information see
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">GitHub's privacy policy</a>.
